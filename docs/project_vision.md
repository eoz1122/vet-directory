# Project Vision for "English Speaking Vets Germany"

> **Use this context for all future AI interactions and development decisions.**

## 1. Core Mission

To be the most trusted, authoritative resource for English-speaking expats in Germany navigating pet care. We are a **"Service-First" platform**, not an ad-farm. Our primary goal is animal welfare and helping the community.

## 2. Origin Story

This project was born from our own struggles as expats. We know the pain of not finding care, and we built this to solve that problem for others. It is personal.

## 3. Monetization Philosophy

We use **"Native & Helpful Affiliate Marketing"**.

* We only recommend products that act as *real solutions* to user problems (e.g., "bureaucracy is difficult -> here is a digital insurance option").
* Revenue is secondary; it exists to cover dedicated time and overheads so we can keep serving the community.

## 4. Tone & Vibe

* **Professional, Empathetic, Expert.**
* Users should feel safe, understood, and informed in a foreign country.

## 5. Partnerships

We work only with high-quality partners like **Petolo**, **Helden.de**, **Zooplus**, and **Feather**. We prioritize long-term user trust over short-term quick cash.

## 6. User Experience

* No intrusive pop-ups.
* No spammy newsletters.
* Value-driven engagement only (e.g., "5-Day Email Courses").
