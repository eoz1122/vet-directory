# 🚨 What to Do in a Pet Emergency: The Germany Survival Guide

It's 11pm on a Sunday. Your dog just ate something toxic. Or your cat is choking. Or your pet is bleeding, vomiting, or clearly in distress. You're panicking, your German is non-existent, and you have no idea where to go or who to call.

This is the nightmare scenario every pet owner dreads. But in Germany, emergency veterinary care is available 24/7 in every major city—if you know where to look and what to expect.

This is your third-grade-simple checklist for when things go wrong after hours. Save this guide. Screenshot the emergency numbers. Know where your nearest 24-hour Tierklinik is *before* you need it.

## Step 1: Is It REALLY an Emergency?

Before you rush to the emergency vet at 2am, ask yourself: does your pet need immediate life-saving care, or can this wait until morning?

### 🚨 THIS IS AN EMERGENCY (Go NOW)

- **Difficulty breathing** – gasping, blue gums, choking
- **Severe bleeding** – blood that won't stop after 5 minutes of pressure
- **Seizures** – lasting more than 2 minutes or multiple seizures
- **Unconsciousness or collapse** – not responsive, limp
- **Suspected poisoning** – chocolate, rat poison, human medications, antifreeze, etc.
- **Trauma** – hit by a car, fall from height, dog fight injuries
- **Bloat** (dogs only) – swollen, hard abdomen with unproductive vomiting
- **Heatstroke** – panting excessively, drooling, collapse in hot weather
- **Eye injuries** – sudden blindness, bleeding from the eye
- **Straining to urinate** – especially in male cats (life-threatening blockage)
- **Sudden paralysis** – can't move legs, dragging hind legs
- **Severe vomiting or diarrhea** – with blood, or if the pet is lethargic and won't drink

### ⏰ THIS CAN WAIT UNTIL MORNING (Call First Thing)

- **Mild vomiting or diarrhea** – one or two episodes, pet is still eating/drinking
- **Limping** – but still able to walk
- **Ear infections** – head shaking, scratching, but no bleeding
- **Hot spots or skin rashes** – itchy but not bleeding
- **Broken toenail** – bleeding but controlled
- **Minor cough or sneezing** – no labored breathing

**When in doubt, CALL the emergency vet first.** They'll tell you if your pet needs to come in immediately or if it can wait.

### 📲 How to Find Emergency Vets in Your Area

**Online Search:**

- Website: <www.tierarzt-notdienst.de> (searchable directory)
- Website: <www.vetfinder.de> (nationwide vet finder)

**Apps:**

- Download the **VetFinder** or **Tierarzt Notdienst** app for quick access to emergency vets near you

---

## Step 3: Call Before You Go

**ALWAYS call the emergency vet before you arrive.** This does three things:

1. **Confirms they're open and accepting emergencies** (some clinics have limited emergency hours)
2. **Prepares the vet for your arrival** (they can have equipment ready)
3. **Gives you instructions** on how to transport your pet safely

### What to Say (in English or German)

**English:**  
"Hello, I have an emergency. My [dog/cat] is [describe symptoms]. Can I bring them in now?"

**German:**  
"Hallo, ich habe einen Notfall. Mein [Hund/Katze] [symptoms]. Kann ich sofort vorbeikommen?"  
Pronounced: *HAH-loh, ikh HAH-buh EYE-nen NOHT-fall. Mine [hoond/KAHT-suh]... kahn ikh zoh-FORT for-BYE-koh-men?*

**Common symptoms in German:**

- Bleeding = blutet (BLOO-tet)
- Vomiting = erbricht sich (air-BRICHT zikh)
- Can't breathe = kann nicht atmen (kahn nikht AHT-men)
- Unconscious = bewusstlos (buh-VOOST-lohs)
- Poisoned = vergiftet (fair-GIF-tet)

---

## Step 4: Transport Your Pet Safely

### For Dogs

- Use a leash or carrier
- If injured, place them on a blanket and lift carefully (support the spine)
- Muzzle if necessary (injured dogs may bite)
- Keep them warm with a blanket

### For Cats

- Use a secure carrier (ALWAYS—cats will bolt if scared)
- Cover the carrier with a towel to reduce stress
- Drive carefully—no sudden stops

### For Bleeding

- Apply firm pressure with a clean towel for 5+ minutes
- Don't keep checking (this disrupts clotting)

### For Poisoning

- Bring the package/container of what they ingested
- Do NOT induce vomiting unless the vet tells you to

## Step 5: The €50 Emergency Fee (And What to Expect)

Here's the reality: emergency veterinary care in Germany is expensive. And it's regulated by law.

### The Emergency Fee (Notdienstgebühr)

**Every emergency visit costs a minimum of €50 on top of treatment costs.**

This fee applies if you visit the vet:

- **Weeknights:** 6pm–8am (Monday–Friday)
- **Weekends:** 6pm Friday–8am Monday
- **Public holidays:** All day

**This €50 fee is mandatory by law.** It's not optional, and it's not negotiable. It's designed to compensate vets for providing 24/7 care.

### The 2×–4× GOT Multiplier

In addition to the €50 fee, **all treatments during emergency hours are billed at 2×–4× the standard rate** (GOT fee schedule).

**Example:**

- Standard consultation during the day: €23 (1× GOT)
- Emergency consultation at night: €46–€92 (2×–4× GOT) + €50 emergency fee
- **Total: €96–€142** just to walk in the door

**Surgery costs can quickly escalate:**

- Emergency abdominal surgery: €800–€3,000
- Emergency orthopedic surgery (broken leg): €1,500–€5,000
- Overnight hospitalization: €100–€300 per night

### Payment

Most emergency vets require **immediate payment** or proof of pet insurance. Bring:

- **Your credit/debit card** (many don't accept cash)
- **Pet insurance details** (if you have it)
- **Your passport/ID** (for billing)

**Pro tip:** If you have pet insurance, call them BEFORE treatment if possible. Some insurers require pre-approval for expensive procedures.

## Step 6: Emergency Numbers That Aren't 112

**Important:** 112 (the general emergency number in Germany) is for HUMAN emergencies only. They won't help with pets.

### 🐾 Pet-Specific Emergency Resources

**Veterinary Poison Control Hotline:**  
📞 **0551 / 19 240** (University of Göttingen, 24/7)  
Free advice for suspected poisonings

**Tierärztlicher Notdienst (National Emergency Vet Finder):**  
🌐 <www.tierarzt-notdienst.de>  
Search by city/postal code for the nearest emergency vet

**Pfotendoctor (Online Vet Consultation):**  
🌐 <www.pfotendoctor.com>  
Video/phone consultations with vets (€35–€75)  
Helpful if you're unsure whether it's an emergency

**TASSO Pet Registry (Lost Pet Hotline):**  
📞 **0 61 90 / 93 73 00** (24/7)  
If your pet escapes during an emergency

---

## Step 7: After the Emergency

### Get All Documents

- **Invoice** (Rechnung) – Itemized bill with GOT multipliers
- **Treatment summary** (Behandlungsbericht) – What was done
- **Medication instructions** (Medikamentengabe) – Dosage and schedule
- **Follow-up appointment details** (Nachuntersuchung)

### Submit to Insurance

If you have pet health insurance, submit:

- Invoice
- Treatment summary
- Proof of payment

Most insurers reimburse within 2–4 weeks.

### Follow-Up Care

Emergency vets stabilize your pet, but you'll likely need to see your regular vet for follow-up care within 24–48 hours. Don't skip this.
